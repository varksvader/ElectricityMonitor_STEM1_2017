Title: Enhancing Smart Grid Technology to the Consumer Level

Engineering Problem:

Consumers are unaware of wasting electricity when using appliances. This misuse causes consumers to use electricity inefficiently which leads to overexertion of fossil fuels and minimized utilization of renewable energy and furthers global warming.

Engineering Goal:

The goal of this project was to engineer a device that could monitor and display the electricity usage per appliance and ensure the consumer is received accurate data to help the consumer use electricity efficiently.

Abstract:

Consumers often waste electricity because they use their appliances inefficiently, contributing to the spread of global warming. Smart grid, an innovative technology which helps utility companies monitor electricity generation and consumption, promotes the use of renewable energy in households to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. The goal of this project was to engineer a consumer extension of smart grid, a device which accurately monitors the electricity consumption of household appliances and educates consumers on how to use electricity efficiently. The device, featuring a microcontroller and a current circuit, measures the consumerâ€™s electricity consumption safely and non-intrusively from the appliance wire. An app was developed with the device to entice consumers to learn about their electricity consumption, such as a preferred amount of electricity to use and optimal times to use their appliances to minimize fossil fuel consumption. The device was tested on a variety of appliances with different energy efficiencies. The measurements obtained by this novel device were compared to measurements obtained from commercially available instruments. The device is extremely accurate (p = 0.995) and extremely precise (STDEV = 0.012 A). When this project is used in conjunction with smart grid, the consumer and energy provider can work together to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and to increase consumer awareness and education. People who use this device will have the power to help secure the future of the Earth and its environment by decreasing their contributions to global warming.
